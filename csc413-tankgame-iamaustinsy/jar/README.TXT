The current working directory to play the game is to go into folder "jar". In this folder you will see the jar executable file
to play the game, this current README, and the Resources that the jar uses to play the game. Clone both the jar and resources.
Then run the jar file. The controls to play the game include: W,A,S,D and SPACEBAR. W moves forward, S moves backwards, A
rotates to the left, and D rotates to the right. SPACEBAR allows the tank to shoot rockets in the direction of the icon. 
I had failed to incorporate player #2 for the game alongside split-screen(obviously) but the commands for it were partially implemented. 
By holding enter and pointing the tank to the left you can show that the tank will take damage. 
The red bubble allows the user to gain extra attack speed, and the blue bubble gives the user an extra life.
Destroying a block will give the user 10 points. Bullets will collide with all object's hitboxes.
This game is pretty bare bones, but I feel that it was a great step in the right direction to comprehend game design and OOP.
